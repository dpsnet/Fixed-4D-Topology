# T10: Motivic Homotopy Theory and Higher Algebraic K-Theory

## A¹-Homotopy Theory, Algebraic Cobordism, and Higher Categories of Motives

**Research Phase**: T10  
**Strictness Level**: L1-L2 (Research-level mathematics)  
**Status**: In Progress

---

## Overview

This ultimate mathematical phase synthesizes T7 (higher structures), T8 (motives), and T9 (derived/spectral geometry) into the most advanced framework:

1. **Motivic Homotopy Theory**: Voevodsky's A¹-homotopy category
2. **Algebraic Cobordism**: Levine-Morel universal oriented cohomology
3. **Higher Algebraic K-Theory**: Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada stable ∞-categories
4. **Higher Categories of Motives**: DG-categories, A_∞-categories, spectral motives
5. **Ultimate Unification**: F4T as motivic spectrum
