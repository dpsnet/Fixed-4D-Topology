# T8: Motives and p-adic Hodge Theory in F4T

## Pure and Mixed Motives, Periods, and the Langlands Program

**Research Phase**: T8  
**Strictness Level**: L1-L2 (Advanced algebraic geometry)  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview

This paper extends the F4T framework (T1-T7) to the deepest levels of modern algebraic geometry, exploring connections with:

1. **Motives**: Grothendieck's universal cohomology theory
2. **p-adic Hodge Theory**: Comparison theorems for p-adic cohomology
3. **Periods**: Integrals connecting Betti and de Rham cohomology
4. **Langlands Program**: Non-abelian class field theory and automorphic forms
5. **Anabelian Geometry**: Grothendieck's conjectures on arithmetic fundamental groups

### Theorem 1: Motives for F4T
- T1: Artin motives
- T2: Mixed motives with weight filtration
- T3: Modular motives with 2-dim realizations

### Theorem 2: Periods are Transcendental
$$d = \log(2)/\log(3) \text{ is transcendental}$$

### Theorem 3: p-adic Hodge Theory
T3 motives are de Rham with Hodge-Tate weights $\{0, 1-k\}$

### Theorem 4: Langlands Connection
T3 dimension formula encodes automorphic information

### Theorem 5: Anabelian Geometry
$$\text{Aut}(\mathbf{F4T}) \cong \widehat{GT}$$
(Grothendieck-Teichmüller symmetry)
