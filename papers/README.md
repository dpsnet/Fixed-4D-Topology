# Fixed 4D Topology - Research Papers

This directory contains the complete research papers for the Fixed 4D Topology unified field theory framework.

## Overview

## Research Methodology

### Layered Strictness Approach

All papers follow a **layered strictness** methodology:

| Level | Description | Papers |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **L1** | 100% rigorous, complete proofs | T1 |
| **L1-L2** | Core strict, extensions progressive | T2 |
| **L2** | Partial results, explicit assumptions | T3 |
| **L2-L3** | Core strict, some heuristic components | T4 |

### Revision Principle

> "宁可删除，不伪造成立" (Rather delete than fake validity)

- All results are honestly labeled with their strictness level
- Gaps in proofs are explicitly marked
- Previous errors have been corrected through honest retraction

---

## Implementation

All theoretical results are implemented in Python and available in `../src/fixed_4d_topology/`:

```python
from fixed_4d_topology import (
    CantorRepresentation,      # T1
    SpectralDimension,         # T2
    ModularCorrespondence,     # T3
    FractalArithmetic          # T4
)
```

See the [main README](../README.md) for usage examples.
