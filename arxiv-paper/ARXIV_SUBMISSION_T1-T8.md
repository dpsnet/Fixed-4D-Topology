## T1 Paper Details

**Title**: Cantor Class Fractal Representation: A Rigorous Approximation Theory for Real Numbers

**Abstract**:
```
We establish a rigorous approximation representation theory for real numbers using Cantor class fractal dimensions. Unlike previous claims of exact representation (shown impossible by cardinality arguments), we prove that any real number can be approximated to precision ε using O(log(1/ε)) Cantor dimension rational combinations. Our main results include: (1) linear independence of Cantor dimensions over ℚ, (2) density of rational combinations in ℝ, (3) a constructive greedy algorithm achieving optimal convergence rate, and (4) an information-theoretic lower bound proving optimality. Numerical validation confirms theoretical predictions.
