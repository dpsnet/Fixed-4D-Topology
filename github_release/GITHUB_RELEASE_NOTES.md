## 📊 Key Scientific Results

### Cross-Material Validation (3D Systems)

| System | Type | $c_1$ Value | Error |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| Cu₂O | Ionic crystal | 0.516 | ±0.030 |
| AgBr | Ionic crystal | 0.508 | ±0.025 |
| AgCl | Ionic crystal | 0.521 | ±0.028 |
| Na | Alkali atom | 0.495 | ±0.015 |
| K | Alkali atom | 0.502 | ±0.018 |
| **Weighted Mean** | - | **0.504** | **±0.009** |

### Statistical Evidence

| Test | Result | Interpretation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| $\\chi^2$ test | $p = 0.899$ | ✅ Consistent with theory |
| $t$-test | $p = 0.720$ | ✅ No significant deviation |
| Bayes factor | $B_{10} = 213.88$ | ✅ Very strong evidence |
| Coincidence probability | $P < 10^{-7}$ | ✅ Rejected |
