RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:
─────────────────────────────────────
Human-AI Collaborative Research:

Human Role:
- Research direction: Define fundamental questions and trajectory
- Architectural selection (NOT design; design by AI): Choose among AI-generated frameworks
- Drive and supervise data validation: Push for experimental validation
- Catch AI hallucinations: Detect AI errors and fabrications
- Scientific judgment: Final decisions on validity and priority

AI Role (Top Mathematician Skills):
- Mathematical derivation with rigorous standards
- Literature synthesis and proof construction
- Rapid exploration of theoretical alternatives
- Systematic research framework execution

Synergy:
Human extends beyond individual mathematical limits through AI;
AI outputs are critically verified by human judgment.

RESEARCH EVOLUTION (Failed → Current):
─────────────────────────────────────
Pre-Open Source (2 major versions abandoned):

Version 1: Phenomenological Approach
- Excessive free parameters requiring continuous adjustment
- Ad hoc adaptations for different physical scales
- Scale-dependent inconsistencies
- Essentially sophisticated curve-fitting, not predictive theory

Version 2: Fractal-Clifford with Dimensional Reduction  
- 11D to 4D continuous dimensional reduction
- Generated fractional dimensions conflicting with General Relativity
- Severe mathematical defects in proofs
- Machine hallucination: AI-generated "proofs" appearing rigorous 
  but containing subtle logical errors

Early Open-Source Phase:
- Mathematics-first approach (M-0 series: M-0.1 to M-0.22)
- Layer-by-layer proof development
- Attempted physical applications after mathematical foundation

The E-7/E-8 Crisis (Experimental-Verification/):
- Observational validation exposed mathematical defects
- Proofs failed under physical constraint integration
- Machine-generated proofs revealed hidden assumptions
- Earlier layer errors propagated through subsequent development

Current Repository (Fixed-4D-Topology):
- Clean break from prior theoretical attempts
- Human-AI collaborative methodology
- Human-verified proofs with AI mathematical assistance
- Explicit L1/L2/L3 strictness labeling
- Full transparency on failed prior attempts

ORIGINAL MOTIVATIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────
1. Nature's fractal self-similarity across all scales
2. Mathematical isomorphism: time dilation ↔ non-Newtonian hardening
3. Zhang Xiangqian's theory: space as spiral divergence motion

Physical Predictions (Future)
        ↓
Experimental Validation (E-series, eventually)

Feedback → Refinement/Correction

This is understood as a long-term closed loop toward unified
field theory, acknowledging individual human limitations while
leveraging AI capabilities for rigorous mathematical progress.

RESEARCH STATEMENT:
─────────────────────────────────────
This repository presents mathematical research conducted through
human-AI collaboration with top-tier mathematician methodology.

Key principles:
• Human-AI collaboration: Human direction + AI execution
• Layered strictness: L1 (100% rigorous) / L2 (progressive) / L3 (heuristic)
• Honest revision: Acknowledging and correcting prior errors
• Complete transparency: 50,000 words, 18 theorems, all proofs included
• Full reproducibility: Python implementation with numerical validation

Status: Mathematical foundations complete. Physical applications 
and experimental validation (E-series) planned for future phases.
