RESEARCH JOURNEY:
─────────────────────────────────────
Origin: Unified Field Theory research (2023-2024) attempting to reconcile
quantum mechanics and general relativity through dynamic spectral dimension.

Crisis: E-7 and E-8 validation attempts against quasar data revealed 
fundamental discrepancies and mathematical inconsistencies when theory 
met observational astrophysical data.

Pivot: Rather than forcing ad hoc modifications, returned to pure 
mathematical foundations. Suspended physical validation pending 
rigorous theoretical consolidation.

Current: Fixed 4D Topology framework—establishing solid mathematical 
groundwork (T1-T4) before attempting physical applications.

RESEARCH ORIGINS:
─────────────────────────────────────
This research emerged from observations about logarithmic structures
appearing across mathematics:

• Fractal dimensions: log N / log r in Hausdorff formulas
• Spectral theory: heat kernel traces on fractals
• Modular forms: L-function values at critical points
• Algebra: operations on scaling factors

Initial intuition: These might be different "lenses" viewing the same
underlying mathematical reality.

Influences: Mandelbrot (fractal vision), Connes (noncommutative geometry),
Strichartz (fractal PDEs), Kigami (analysis on fractals), Langlands
(deep connections program).

Evolution: M-0 exploratory series (2024-2025) → Error correction → 
Current T1-T4 framework with explicit strictness labels.

RESEARCH STATEMENT:
─────────────────────────────────────
This repository presents original mathematical research conducted through
AI-independent deep derivation methodology. The work features:

• Layered strictness: L1 (100% rigorous) / L2 (progressive) / L3 (heuristic)
• Honest revision: M-0 series errors corrected in T1-T4 framework
• Complete transparency: 50,000 words, 18 theorems, all proofs included
• Full reproducibility: Python implementation with numerical validation

The research evolved from initial over-claims (M-0 v2.0) to honest 
approximation framework (v2.1) following "宁可删除，不伪造成立" 
(Rather delete than fake validity) principle.

Status: Research complete, open for peer review and collaboration.
