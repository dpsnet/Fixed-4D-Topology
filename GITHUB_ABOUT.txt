RESEARCH JOURNEY:
─────────────────────────────────────
Prior Research (2023-2024):
- Multi-repository program: Advanced-Physics-Framework,
  Advanced-Theoretical-Framework, Computational-Framework,
  Experimental-Verification, Fundamental-Mathematics, etc.
- Pursued "Fixed 4D Topology with Dynamic Spectral Dimension 
  and Multiple Twisted Fractal Clifford Algebra" unified field theory

The Crisis (Experimental-Verification/):
- E-7: Validation attempts revealing mathematical inconsistencies
- E-8: Extended analysis showing validation failures
- Fundamental issues: Dimensional anomalies, Clifford algebra 
  contradictions, prediction failures

The Pivot (late 2024):
- Suspended unified field theory program
- Extracted sound mathematical components
- Rebuilt from first principles with proof-first methodology
- Abandoned physical predictions until mathematical rigor guaranteed

Current Repository:
- Mathematical distillate of failed physics program
- T1-T4: Rigorous core that survived critical examination
- Purified framework freed from premature physical applications

RESEARCH ORIGINS:
─────────────────────────────────────
This research emerged from observations about logarithmic structures
appearing across mathematics:

• Fractal dimensions: log N / log r in Hausdorff formulas
• Spectral theory: heat kernel traces on fractals
• Modular forms: L-function values at critical points
• Algebra: operations on scaling factors

Initial intuition: These might be different "lenses" viewing the same
underlying mathematical reality.

Influences: Mandelbrot (fractal vision), Connes (noncommutative geometry),
Strichartz (fractal PDEs), Kigami (analysis on fractals), Langlands
(deep connections program).

Evolution: M-0 exploratory series (2024-2025) → Error correction → 
Current T1-T4 framework with explicit strictness labels.

RESEARCH STATEMENT:
─────────────────────────────────────
This repository presents mathematical research conducted through
AI-independent deep derivation methodology.

Key principles:
• Layered strictness: L1 (100% rigorous) / L2 (progressive) / L3 (heuristic)
• Honest revision: Acknowledging and correcting prior errors
• Complete transparency: 50,000 words, 18 theorems, all proofs included
• Full reproducibility: Python implementation with numerical validation

Status: Mathematical foundations complete. Physical applications 
deliberately suspended pending peer review and validation.
