ORIGINAL MOTIVATIONS (Why Unified Field Theory?):
─────────────────────────────────────
1. Nature's fractal self-similarity
   Observed across cosmic, biological, geological scales—suggesting 
   fractal geometry as fundamental, not merely descriptive

2. Mathematical isomorphism intuition
   Noticed parallel between:
   - General relativistic time dilation (non-linear field response)
   - Non-Newtonian fluid shear hardening (non-linear stress response)
   Suggested gravity might have "material-like" geometric structure

3. Zhang Xiangqian's influence
   Core insight: Space is dynamic spiral divergence from center to 
   periphery, not static background. Suggested twisted/torsional 
   geometries beyond Riemannian manifolds.

RESEARCH JOURNEY:
─────────────────────────────────────
Prior Research (2023-2024):
- Multi-repository program: Advanced-Physics-Framework,
  Advanced-Theoretical-Framework, Computational-Framework,
  Experimental-Verification, Fundamental-Mathematics, etc.
- Framework: "Fixed 4D Topology + Dynamic Spectral Dimension + 
  Multiple Twisted Fractal Clifford Algebra"

The Crisis (Experimental-Verification/):
- E-7, E-8: Validation attempts revealing mathematical inconsistencies
- Clifford algebra contradictions, dimensional anomalies
- Physical predictions failed against observational data

The Pivot (late 2024):
- Suspended unified field theory program
- Extracted sound mathematical components
- Rebuilt with proof-first methodology

Current Repository:
- Mathematical distillate of failed physics program
- T1-T4: Rigorous core surviving critical examination
- Purified framework freed from premature physical applications

RESEARCH STATEMENT:
─────────────────────────────────────
This repository presents mathematical research conducted through
AI-independent deep derivation methodology.

Key principles:
• Layered strictness: L1 (100% rigorous) / L2 (progressive) / L3 (heuristic)
• Honest revision: Acknowledging and correcting prior errors
• Complete transparency: 50,000 words, 18 theorems, all proofs included
• Full reproducibility: Python implementation with numerical validation

Status: Mathematical foundations complete. Physical applications 
deliberately suspended pending peer review and validation.
