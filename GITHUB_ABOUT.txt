RESEARCH EVOLUTION (Failed → Current):
─────────────────────────────────────
Pre-Open Source (2 major versions abandoned):

Version 1: Phenomenological Approach
- Excessive free parameters requiring continuous adjustment
- Ad hoc adaptations for different physical scales
- Scale-dependent inconsistencies
- Essentially sophisticated curve-fitting, not predictive theory

Version 2: Fractal-Clifford with Dimensional Reduction  
- 11D to 4D continuous dimensional reduction
- Generated fractional dimensions conflicting with General Relativity
- Severe mathematical defects in proofs
- Machine hallucination: AI-generated "proofs" appearing rigorous 
  but containing subtle logical errors

Early Open-Source Phase:
- Mathematics-first approach (M-0 series: M-0.1 to M-0.22)
- Layer-by-layer proof development
- Attempted physical applications after mathematical foundation

The E-7/E-8 Crisis (Experimental-Verification/):
- Observational validation exposed mathematical defects
- Proofs failed under physical constraint integration
- Machine-generated proofs revealed hidden assumptions
- Earlier layer errors propagated through subsequent development

Current Repository (Fixed-4D-Topology):
- Clean break from all prior theoretical attempts
- AI-independent methodology (human-verified proofs only)
- Layered strictness: L1/L2/L3 explicit labeling
- Proof-first: Mathematics before physical interpretation
- Full transparency on failed prior attempts

ORIGINAL MOTIVATIONS (Why research began):
─────────────────────────────────────
1. Nature's fractal self-similarity across all scales
2. Mathematical isomorphism: time dilation ↔ non-Newtonian hardening
3. Zhang Xiangqian's theory: space as spiral divergence motion
