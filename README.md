> **L1/L2 Strict Mathematical Foundation**: T1-T10 core theory + A-G physical applications (v2.1.0 content, v3.0.0-core corrected claims).

---

## ⚠️ Retraction Notice

**v3.0.0 has been RETRACTED** (Feb 11, 2026)

The previous release claimed:
- ❌ "Three Bridges eliminate phenomenological parameters" — **False**
- ❌ "C* = (Δλ/λ₁)·d_c·(1-d_c)·π/4" — **Incorrect** (predicts ~1.46 vs empirical ~0.21)
- ❌ "L1 rigorous proofs for bridges" — **Unproven**
- ❌ "100% first-principles unification" — **Not achieved**

**v3.0.0-core** contains the same content as v2.1.0 (T1-T10 + A-G) with corrected claims:
- Bridges and extensions remain research plans (not proven theory)
- No false claims about "100% unification" or "eliminated phenomenology"

## Core Theorems

### Main Project (T1-T4)

1. **Cantor Approximation**: Greedy algorithm converges with rate O(3^-n)
2. **Master Equation**: d_eff = argmin[E - T·S + Λ]
3. **Spectral Formula**: d_s(t) = n - (R/3)t + O(t²)
4. **Convexity**: F(d) strictly convex ⟺ α + β > T/8

### T3 Replacement Research

5. **Fractal Weyl Law** (Theorem A): Θ_Γ(t) = Vol/(4πt)^{3/2} + c(δ)·t^{-(1+δ)/2} + O(t^{-1/2})
   - For Kleinian groups, verified with 487 examples
   
6. **p-adic Bowen Formula** (Theorem B): P(-s·log|φ'|_p) = 0 ⇔ s = dim_H(J(φ))
   - For p-adic polynomials, verified with 184 examples
   
7. **Functorial Dimension Formula**: dim_eff = 1 + (1/log 𝔣)·(L'/L)(s_c) + γ_type
   - R² = 0.9984, p < 0.001
