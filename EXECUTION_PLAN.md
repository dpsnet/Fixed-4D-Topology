## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Plan |
|------|-----------------|
| Mathematical derivation fails | Pivot to information-theoretic or phenomenological approach |
| E-6 resources unavailable | Focus on numerical simulations and existing data analysis |
| Publication delays | Submit to multiple venues, maintain preprint on arXiv |

---

## Communication Plan

- **Daily**: Individual task updates (async)
- **Weekly**: Team sync meeting (30 min)
- **Monthly**: Milestone review and roadmap adjustment
- **Quarterly**: External advisor consultation

---

## Success Indicators

### Green Flags (On Track)
- Mathematical framework established by Month 3
- E-6 prototype operational by Month 6
- First paper submitted by Month 6
- RG connection identified by Month 9

### Red Flags (Need Intervention)
- No progress on fractal derivation by Month 4
- E-6 prototype fails feasibility by Month 5
- Multiple paper rejections without resubmission path
