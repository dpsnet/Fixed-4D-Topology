  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS:
  This project employs a human-AI collaborative paradigm with transparent
  disclosure of limitations:
  
  - Human Researcher: Provides mathematical intuition and research direction
    but ACKNOWLEDGES LIMITED EXPERTISE to rigorously verify advanced 
    mathematical physics content.
  
  - Kimi 2.5 Agent: Generates ALL content including mathematical derivations,
    software, WRITING, VISUALIZATIONS, and documentation.
  
  - Professional verification: DEFERRED to academic community. This is an
    open research artifact for peer review, NOT a verified publication.

title: "Fixed 4D Topology: Dynamic Spectral Dimension Unified Field Theory"
abstract: >-
  A rigorous mathematical framework unifying fractal geometry, 
  spectral theory, modular forms, and algebraic topology through 
  dynamic spectral dimension. Includes four main theory threads: 
  Cantor representation, spectral dimension PDE, modular-fractal 
  correspondence, and fractal arithmetic.
  
  Developed using human-AI collaborative methodology:
  - AI generated all mathematical content, writing, and visualizations
  - Human provided conceptual direction with limited technical verification
  - Professional peer review is invited and needed
  
  Full transparency and open documentation.

    Open-source research artifact employing human-AI collaborative methodology.
    AI generated all content (mathematics, writing, visuals); human provided
    conceptual direction but acknowledges limited capability to verify technical
    content. Professional peer review is invited and needed.
    Formatted per Reviews in Mathematical Physics guidelines but not formally
    submitted to journal.
