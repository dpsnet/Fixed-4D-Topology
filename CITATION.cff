title: "Fixed 4D Topology: Dynamic Spectral Dimension Unified Field Theory"
abstract: "A rigorous mathematical framework unifying fractal geometry, spectral theory, modular forms, and algebraic topology through dynamic spectral dimension. Includes four main theory threads: Cantor representation, spectral dimension PDE, modular-fractal correspondence, and fractal arithmetic."
