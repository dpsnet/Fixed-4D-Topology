## Research Methodology

This research employs a **human-AI collaborative paradigm** with clearly defined roles and **honest disclosure of limitations**, consistent with the Fixed-4D-Topology framework.

### Human Researcher (Principal Investigator)
**Name**: Wang Bin (王斌)  
**Role**: 独立研究员 (Independent Researcher)  
**Email**: wang.bin@foxmail.com

**Role**: Supervisor, Decision Maker, Research Director

**Capabilities and Limitations**:
- **Conceptualization**: Providing fundamental insights into neural network effective dimension theory
- **Research Direction**: Supervising and selecting the theoretical framework and research trajectory
- **Quality Control**: *Limited capability* - The human researcher has foundational understanding but **cannot rigorously verify** advanced mathematical derivations
- **Original Ideas**: Providing foundational concepts and research hypotheses
- **Final Decisions**: Determining the scope, assumptions, and conclusions

**⚠️ Important Limitation**: Due to limited expertise in advanced mathematical physics and deep learning theory, the human researcher **cannot provide rigorous peer-review-level validation** of all mathematical content. Formal verification is deferred to future professional reviewers.

### Kimi 2.5 Agent (AI Research Assistant)
**Provider**: Moonshot AI  
**Role**: Autonomous Derivation, Development, and Documentation Engine

**Contributions**:
- **Mathematical Derivation**: Autonomously completing rigorous mathematical proofs and theorem derivations
- **Theory Development**: Conducting systematic theoretical推演论证 (deductive reasoning and theoretical validation)
- **Software Development**: Developing and running numerical validation programs (E1-E6 experiments)
- **Writing - Original Draft**: Composing all written content, explanations, and scientific narrative
- **Visualization**: Designing and implementing all figures, plots, and graphical representations
- **Documentation**: Recording and publishing all research steps with full transparency
- **LaTeX Production**: Converting mathematical content into publication-ready format
