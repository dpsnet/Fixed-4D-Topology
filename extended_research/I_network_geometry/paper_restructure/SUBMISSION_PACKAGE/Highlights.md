# Highlights (3-5 bullet points)

## For: "Effective Dimensions of Complex Networks: A Large-Scale Empirical Study"

---

### Highlight 1
**First comprehensive empirical study of network effective dimensions across multiple domains, analyzing 2.1 million nodes from seven real-world networks.**

---

### Highlight 2
**Significant simulated-empirical divergence discovered: BA/WS model-generated networks yield dimensions 24-336% lower than real-world networks, indicating simulation fidelity limitations for complex systems.**

---

### Highlight 3
**Established hierarchy of network dimensions: Global infrastructure (d≈4.4) > Academic collaboration (d≈3.0) > Social/Biological networks (d≈2.0-2.6) > Communication networks (d≈1.2).**

---

### Highlight 4
**Biological networks exhibit unexpectedly high dimensions: Yeast protein-protein interaction networks (d≈2.4) are comparable to social networks, challenging the assumption of tree-like structures.**

---

### Highlight 5
**Model accuracy is scale-dependent: Accurate for regional networks (Power Grid: 5% error) but fails for global complex systems (Internet AS: 438% error).**
