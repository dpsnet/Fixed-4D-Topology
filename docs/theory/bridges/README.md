# Three Bridges: Research Hypotheses

## Honest Assessment

The "Three Bridges" are **research hypotheses**, not proven theorems.

## Bridge Status

| Bridge | Topic | Status | Reality |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| **A** | Critical Exponent | 🟡 Hypothesis | C* = 0.21 is phenomenological; no strict derivation |
| **B** | Neural Weights | 🟡 Hypothesis | Heuristic RG connection; not proven |
| **C** | Quantum Equivalence | 🟡 Hypothesis | Unitary transform not constructed |

## Previous Claims (RETRACTED)

The following claims have been **REMOVED** as incorrect:

1. ❌ "100% phenomenology eliminated"
2. ❌ "All parameters derived from first principles"
3. ❌ "L1 rigorous proofs"
4. ❌ Formula: C* = (Δλ/λ₁) · d_c · (1-d_c) · π/4

## Current Understanding

The bridges provide **heuristic connections** between different aspects of the theory:
- They suggest possible relationships
- They are subjects for future research
- They have **not eliminated** phenomenological parameters

## Research Directions

For each bridge:
- [Bridge A](A-critical-exponent/) - Find correct relationship between C* and spectral theory
- [Bridge B](B-neural-network/) - Derive weight formula from first principles
- [Bridge C](C-quantum/) - Construct explicit unitary equivalence or refute

**This is work in progress. No strict unification has been achieved.**
