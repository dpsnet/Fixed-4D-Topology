# Bridge C: Quantum Equivalence - RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS

## Status

🟡 **RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS** - NOT CONSTRUCTIVELY PROVEN

## Current Understanding

**Conjecture**: Neural network Hamiltonian H_NN and network Laplacian L_network may be related by unitary equivalence:

```
H_NN = U · L_network · U†
```

## Honest Assessment

This is a **mathematical conjecture**, not a proven theorem:
- The unitary transformation U is **not explicitly constructed**
- Spectral correlation (0.98) shows similarity but **not proof of unitary equivalence**
- Physical interpretation of this equivalence is **unclear**

## Open Questions

1. Can the unitary U be explicitly constructed?
2. What are the physical consequences of this equivalence?
3. Is this a deep connection or formal similarity?

## Status

**Bridge C is a conjecture requiring rigorous proof or refutation.**
