# Bridge B: Neural Network Weights - RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS

## Status

🟡 **RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS** - NOT RIGOROUSLY PROVEN

## Current Understanding

**Observation**: Network weights w_i may relate to RG eigenvalues at criticality.

Proposed relationship:
```
w_i ∝ 1/|λ_i| at α + β = T/8
```

## Honest Assessment

This is a **heuristic connection**, not a theorem:
- The relationship between variational weights and RG eigenvalues is **conjectural**
- The critical condition α + β = T/8 is **not derived** from first principles
- Numerical verification shows correlations but **not causal derivation**

## Open Questions

1. Can the weight formula be derived from the Master Equation?
2. Is the RG connection rigorous or coincidental?
3. What is the domain of validity of this relationship?

## Status

**Bridge B is a research hypothesis requiring further development.**
