# Bridge A: Critical Exponent - RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS

## Status

🟡 **RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS** - NOT A PROVEN THEOREM

## Current Understanding

**Empirical Observation**: C* ≈ 0.21

This value is determined from numerical experiments with Cantor set approximations. It is a **phenomenological parameter**, not derived from first principles.

## Open Problem

The relationship between Cantor complexity C* and fractal Laplacian spectral properties remains **unproven**.

### Previously Claimed (REMOVED)

The formula:
```
C* = (Δλ/λ₁) · d_c · (1-d_c) · π/4
```

has been **REMOVED** from this project as it was found to be **incorrect**:
- Predicted value: ~1.46
- Empirical value: ~0.21
- Error: ~600%

## Research Questions

1. Is there a rigorous relationship between C* and the spectral gap of fractal Laplacian?
2. What is the correct mathematical structure connecting discrete Cantor complexity to continuous spectral theory?
3. Can C* be derived from axioms A1-A9, or must it remain a phenomenological input?

## Code

[code/](code/) contains exploratory research code, not rigorous proof.

## Honest Assessment

**Bridge A is a research direction, not a completed derivation.**

The claim that "all phenomenological parameters have been eliminated" was **incorrect** for Bridge A.
