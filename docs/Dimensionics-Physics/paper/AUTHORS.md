**Dimensionics-Physics: Spectral Dimension Flow and Quantum Gravity**

---

## Research Methodology

This research employs a **human-AI collaborative paradigm** with clearly defined roles and **honest disclosure of limitations**:

### Wang Bin (王斌) (Principal Investigator)
**Role**: Supervisor, Decision Maker, Assistant  
**Capabilities and Limitations**:
- **Mathematical and Physical Intuition**: Providing fundamental insights into spectral dimension flow and quantum gravity
- **Research Direction**: Supervising and selecting the theoretical framework and research trajectory
- **Quality Control**: *Limited capability* - The human researcher has basic understanding but **cannot rigorously verify** advanced mathematical physics derivations
- **Original Data**: Providing foundational concepts and research hypotheses
- **Final Decisions**: Determining the scope, assumptions, and conclusions of the theory

**⚠️ Important Limitation**: Due to limited expertise in advanced mathematical physics, the human researcher **cannot provide rigorous peer-review-level validation** of the mathematical content. Formal verification is deferred to future professional reviewers.

### Kimi 2.5 Agent (AI Research Assistant)
**Role**: Autonomous Derivation, Development, and Documentation Engine  
**Contributions**:
- **Mathematical Derivation**: Autonomously completing rigorous mathematical proofs and theorem derivations
- **Theory Development**: Conducting systematic theoretical推演论证 (deductive reasoning and theoretical validation)
- **Software Development**: Developing and running numerical validation programs
- **Writing - Original Draft**: Composing all written content, explanations, and scientific narrative
- **Visualization**: Designing and implementing all figures, plots, and graphical representations
- **Documentation**: Recording and publishing all research steps with full transparency
- **LaTeX Production**: Converting mathematical content into publication-ready format

### Collaboration Statement
This work represents a **transparent human-AI collaboration** where:
1. All research steps are honestly documented and publicly available
2. The human researcher maintains intellectual oversight and final authority within their capability
3. AI contributions are explicitly acknowledged as the primary content generator
4. **Limitations are openly disclosed**: Human technical review is limited; professional verification is welcomed
5. The work is published as an **open research artifact** for community validation

## Limitations and Disclaimers

### Mathematical Rigor
The mathematical content (12 theorems, 9 axioms) has been **formally structured by AI** with claimed L1 strictness. However:
- Human researcher **cannot independently verify** all proof details
- **Professional peer review is needed** for validation
- Community verification is invited via GitHub Issues

### Writing and Visualization
- **All written content** is AI-generated based on human direction
- **All figures and visualizations** are AI-created
- Human provides high-level guidance but not detailed content

### Quality Assurance Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Mathematical proofs | ⚠️ **Pending verification** | Structured by AI; needs expert review |
| Physical predictions | ✅ Human validated | At conceptual level |
| Citation accuracy | ⚠️ **Pending verification** | AI-generated; may need checking |
| Language quality | ✅ AI-generated | Professional standard |
