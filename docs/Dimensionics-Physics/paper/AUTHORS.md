## Research Methodology

This research employs a **human-AI collaborative paradigm** with clearly defined roles:

### Human Researcher (Principal Investigator)
**Role**: Supervisor, Decision Maker, Assistant  
**Contributions**:
- **Mathematical and Physical Intuition**: Providing fundamental insights into spectral dimension flow and quantum gravity
- **Research Direction**: Supervising and selecting the theoretical framework and research trajectory
- **Quality Control**: Reviewing and validating all mathematical derivations and physical predictions
- **Original Data**: Providing foundational concepts and research hypotheses
- **Final Decisions**: Determining the scope, assumptions, and conclusions of the theory

### Kimi 2.5 Agent (AI Research Assistant)
**Role**: Autonomous Derivation and Development Engine  
**Contributions**:
- **Mathematical Derivation**: Autonomously completing rigorous mathematical proofs and theorem derivations under human supervision
- **Theory Development**: Conducting systematic theoretical推演论证 (deductive reasoning and theoretical validation)
- **Software Development**: Developing and running numerical validation programs
- **Documentation**: Recording and publishing all research steps with full transparency
- **LaTeX Production**: Converting mathematical content into publication-ready format

### Collaboration Statement
This work represents a **transparent human-AI collaboration** where:
1. All research steps are honestly documented and publicly available
2. The human researcher maintains intellectual oversight and final authority
3. AI contributions are explicitly acknowledged as computational assistance
4. Mathematical rigor is achieved through iterative human-AI verification
