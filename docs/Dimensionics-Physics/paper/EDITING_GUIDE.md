- **Ch 3 + Ch 5**: RG analysis and UV fixed point
- **Ch 6 + Ch 7**: CMB data discussion

### 2. Move to Appendices
- Detailed numerical methods
- Extended comparison tables
- Multiple proof variants

### 3. Remove Entire Sections
- [ ] 1.3.2 (Existing Frameworks detailed discussion)
- [ ] 1.4.4 (Relation to M-Series in intro)
- [ ] 3.5 (AS Gravity - covered in Ch 8)
- [ ] 4.4 (Detailed kinematic effects)
- [ ] 7.6 (Separate error analysis)
- [ ] 8.9 (Limitations - move to Ch 9)

### 4. Condense Tables
- Reduce 12 theorems table to key 6
- Single predictions table (remove repeated descriptions)
- Merge comparison tables
