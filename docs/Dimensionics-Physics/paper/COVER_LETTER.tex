\opening{Dear Editor,}

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled:\\

\textbf{``Dimensionics-Physics: Spectral Dimension Flow and Quantum Gravity''}\\

for consideration for publication in \textit{Reviews in Mathematical Physics}.

\textbf{Summary of Contribution:}

This work establishes a rigorous mathematical framework treating spacetime dimension as a dynamical variable. Building upon the Fixed-4D-Topology paradigm, we derive nine axioms defining spectral dimension $d_s(\mu)$ governed by the Master Equation $\mu \partial_\mu d_s = \beta(d_s)$.

Our key contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{12 theorems} with rigorous proofs (L1 strictness), including UV fixed point $\lim_{\mu \to \infty} d_s = 2$
    \item \textbf{Modified relativity} with effective metric $g^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{4}{d_s}g_{\mu\nu}$ and deformed Lorentz group $SO(3,1; d_s)$
    \item \textbf{Black hole dimension compression} formula $d_s(r) = 4 - r_s/r$
    \item \textbf{Cosmic dimension evolution} $d_s(t) = 2 + \frac{2}{1 + e^{-(t-t_c)/\tau}}$
    \item \textbf{11 experimental predictions}, including CMB power spectrum modifications testable by CMB-S4 and gravitational wave dispersion accessible to LISA
\end{itemize}

Four predictions already show quantitative agreement with data (percolation, networks, spin chains, critical exponents).

\textbf{Why RMP:}

This work bridges mathematical physics (axiomatic framework, rigorous proofs) with physical applications (quantum gravity, cosmology, testable predictions). The mathematical rigor combined with near-term experimental accessibility makes it particularly suitable for Reviews in Mathematical Physics.
