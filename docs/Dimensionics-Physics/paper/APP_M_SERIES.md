## B.1 Statement of Independence

Dimensionics-Physics is **independent** of the M-1 through M-10 series of the Advanced-Theoretical-Framework [1]. While M-1's methodological ideas influenced our approach, all mathematical definitions, theorem proofs, and physical predictions were derived independently within the Fixed-4D-Topology framework [2].

## B.2 What Was Borrowed

### B.2.1 From M-1: Methodological Ideas

| Aspect | M-1 Contribution | Usage in Dimensionics |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Problem formulation** | Structure for defining physical problems | Adapted to L1 strictness |
| **Fixed 4D + Dynamic $d_s$** | Core paradigm | Retained as foundation |
| **Level system (L1-L3)** | Strictness classification | Fully adopted |

**Attribution**: The "Fixed 4D Topology + Dynamic Spectral Dimension" paradigm originated in M-1 and has been adopted as the foundational assumption of Dimensionics-Physics.

### B.2.2 Methodological vs. Content Distinction

**Borrowed** (methodology):
- The paradigm of fixed topology with dynamic dimension
- The strictness level system (L1-L3)
- The concept of dimension flow

**Not borrowed** (content):
- Specific equations from M-2 through M-10
- Numerical results from M-series
- Physical predictions from M-series
- Interpretations and conclusions

## B.3 What Was Developed Independently

### B.3.1 Mathematical Framework

| Component | M-Series | Dimensionics | Relation |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Axioms** | Implicit in M-1 | 9 explicit axioms (A1-A9) | Independent development |
| **Master Equation** | Mentioned in M-1 | Rigorous derivation (A4) | Independent proof |
| **Beta function** | Not specified | $\beta(d) = -\alpha(d-2)(4-d)$ | Independent construction |
| **Effective metric** | Heuristic | Theorem 4.1 with proof | Independent derivation |
| **Modified Lorentz group** | Not discussed | $SO(3,1; d_s)$ group structure | Independent discovery |

### B.3.2 Physical Predictions

| Prediction | M-Series | Dimensionics | Agreement? |
|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **P1 (CMB)** | Qualitative mention | Quantitative formula | Consistent |
| **P2 (GW)** | Qualitative mention | Quantitative formula | Consistent |
| **UV fixed point** | Heuristic | Rigorous proof | Consistent |
| **BH dimension** | Not discussed | $d_s(r) = 4 - r_s/r$ | New result |
| **11 predictions** | Not systematically listed | Complete table | Independent |

### B.3.3 Numerical Validation

| Validation | M-Series | Dimensionics | Status |
|------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **iTEBD** | Mentioned | Detailed comparison | Independent analysis |
| **Percolation** | Not discussed | Full simulation | Independent work |
| **ODE solver** | Not discussed | $< 10^{-8}$ error | Independent verification |

## B.4 Key Differences

### B.4.1 Strictness Level

| Aspect | M-Series | Dimensionics |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Overall level** | L2-L3 (heuristic) | L1 (100% strict) |
| **Definitions** | Some informal | All rigorous |
| **Theorems** | Most unproven | All proved |
| **Predictions** | Qualitative | Quantitative with errors |

**Example**: M-1 mentions dimension flow; Dimensionics proves $\lim_{\mu \to \infty} d_s = 2$ (Theorem 5.2).

### B.4.2 Mathematical Rigor

**M-Series approach**:
- Intuitive arguments
- Physical plausibility
- Exploratory calculations

**Dimensionics approach**:
- Axiomatic foundation
- Theorem-proof structure
- Numerical validation
- Error analysis

### B.4.3 Scope

| Feature | M-Series | Dimensionics |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Number of documents** | 10 (M-1 to M-10) | 7 core documents |
| **Pages** | ~200 | ~100 (core) |
| **Focus** | Broad exploration | Focused derivation |
| **Target** | Framework development | Paper publication |

## B.5 Why Independence Matters

### B.5.1 Scientific Rigor

Independence ensures:
- No circular reasoning
- Independent verification
- Robustness of results

### B.5.2 Intellectual Property

Clear separation:
- M-1: Original paradigm
- Dimensionics: Rigorous development
- Credit properly attributed

### B.5.3 Citation Clarity

Readers can distinguish:
- What comes from M-1 (paradigm)
- What is new (proofs, predictions)
- What is independent validation

## B.7 Conclusion

Dimensionics-Physics:
1. **Acknowledges** M-1's paradigm (Fixed 4D + Dynamic $d_s$)
2. **Independently develops** all mathematical content
3. **Achieves** L1 strictness (vs L2-L3 in M-series)
4. **Derives** quantitative, testable predictions
5. **Validates** through numerical cross-checks

**Relationship**: M-1 provided the seed; Dimensionics grew the tree.
