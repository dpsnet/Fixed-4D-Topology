title: "Dimensionics-Physics: Spectral Dimension Flow and Quantum Gravity"
abstract: >-
  We present Dimensionics-Physics, a rigorous mathematical framework 
  treating spacetime dimension as a dynamical variable that flows with 
  energy scale. Building upon the Fixed-4D-Topology paradigm, we establish 
  nine axioms defining the spectral dimension function d_s(μ): M × ℝ⁺ → [2,4] 
  governed by the Master Equation μ ∂_μ d_s = β(d_s). 
  
  Our main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of the UV fixed point 
  lim_{μ → ∞} d_s = 2 via renormalization group analysis; (2) Modified 
  relativity theory with effective metric g^{eff}_{μν} = (4/d_s)g_{μν} and 
  deformed Lorentz group SO(3,1; d_s); (3) Black hole dimension compression 
  d_s(r) = 4 - r_s/r; (4) Cosmic dimension evolution 
  d_s(t) = 2 + 2/(1 + e^{-(t-t_c)/τ}).
  
  We derive 11 experimental predictions, including: P1—CMB power spectrum 
  modification testable by CMB-S4; and P2—gravitational wave dispersion 
  accessible to LISA. Four predictions already agree with data.

notes: >-
  This paper establishes 9 axioms (A1-A9), proves 12 theorems with L1 
  strictness, and derives 11 experimental predictions. Four predictions 
  (P4, P8, P9, P11) already show quantitative agreement with data.
  
  Key predictions:
  - P1: CMB power spectrum modification (CMB-S4, 2025-2030)
  - P2: Gravitational wave dispersion (LISA, 2030+)
