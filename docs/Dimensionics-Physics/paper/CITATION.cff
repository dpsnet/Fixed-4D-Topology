  IMPORTANT RESEARCH METHODOLOGY NOTICE:
  This research employs a human-AI collaborative paradigm with transparent
  disclosure of limitations:
  
  - Human Researcher: Provided mathematical intuition and research direction.
    ACKNOWLEDGES LIMITED EXPERTISE to rigorously verify advanced mathematical
    physics content.
  
  - Kimi 2.5 Agent: Autonomously completed ALL mathematical derivations,
    theory development, WRITING, VISUALIZATION, and documentation.
  
  - Professional verification of mathematical rigor is DEFERRED to the
    academic community. This work is published as an open research artifact
    for peer review, NOT as a verified, peer-reviewed publication.

title: "Dimensionics-Physics: Spectral Dimension Flow and Quantum Gravity"
abstract: >-
  We present Dimensionics-Physics, a rigorous mathematical framework 
  treating spacetime dimension as a dynamical variable that flows with 
  energy scale. Building upon the Fixed-4D-Topology paradigm, we establish 
  nine axioms defining the spectral dimension function d_s(μ): M × ℝ⁺ → [2,4] 
  governed by the Master Equation μ ∂_μ d_s = β(d_s). 
  
  Our main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of the UV fixed point 
  lim_{μ → ∞} d_s = 2 via renormalization group analysis; (2) Modified 
  relativity theory with effective metric g^{eff}_{μν} = (4/d_s)g_{μν} and 
  deformed Lorentz group SO(3,1; d_s); (3) Black hole dimension compression 
  d_s(r) = 4 - r_s/r; (4) Cosmic dimension evolution 
  d_s(t) = 2 + 2/(1 + e^{-(t-t_c)/τ}).
  
  We derive 11 experimental predictions, including: P1—CMB power spectrum 
  modification testable by CMB-S4; and P2—gravitational wave dispersion 
  accessible to LISA. Four predictions already agree with data.
  
  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: This research was conducted using a human-AI
  collaborative paradigm. The AI system (Kimi 2.5) generated ALL content
  including mathematical derivations, writing, and visualizations. The human
  researcher provided conceptual direction but ACKNOWLEDGES LIMITED CAPABILITY
  to verify advanced mathematical physics content. Professional peer review
  is INVITED and NEEDED for rigorous verification.

  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS:
  
  This work employs a transparent human-AI collaborative paradigm with
  explicit acknowledgment of limitations:
  
  Human Researcher (Principal Investigator):
  - Mathematical and physical intuition at conceptual level
  - Research direction and high-level supervision
  - Original hypotheses and research vision
  - ⚠️ ACKNOWLEDGES LIMITED EXPERTISE to verify advanced mathematical physics
  - ⚠️ CANNOT provide peer-review-level validation of theorem proofs
  
  Kimi 2.5 Agent (AI Research Assistant):
  - ✅ ALL mathematical derivation and proof construction
  - ✅ ALL theory development and推演论证
  - ✅ ALL software development and numerical validation
  - ✅ ALL written content (original draft)
  - ✅ ALL visualizations and figure generation
  - ✅ ALL documentation and LaTeX production
  
  VERIFICATION STATUS:
  - Mathematical proofs (L1 claimed): ⚠️ PENDING professional verification
  - Citation accuracy: ⚠️ PENDING expert review
  - Physical predictions: ✅ Conceptually validated by human
  - Technical rigor: ⚠️ DEFERRED to community review
  
  This is an OPEN RESEARCH ARTIFACT published for community evaluation.
  Professional peer review is INVITED via GitHub Issues.
  
  This paper establishes 9 axioms (A1-A9), claims 12 theorems with L1 
  strictness, and derives 11 experimental predictions. Four predictions 
  (P4, P8, P9, P11) show conceptual agreement with known data.
  
  Key predictions:
  - P1: CMB power spectrum modification (CMB-S4, 2025-2030)
  - P2: Gravitational wave dispersion (LISA, 2030+)
