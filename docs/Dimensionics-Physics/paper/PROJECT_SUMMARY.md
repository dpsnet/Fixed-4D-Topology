## Key Equations Summary

### Master Equation
$$\mu \frac{\partial d_s}{\partial \mu} = \beta(d_s) = -\alpha(d_s - 2)(4 - d_s)$$

### Effective Metric
$$g^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{4}{d_s} g_{\mu\nu}$$

### Cosmic Evolution
$$d_s(t) = 2 + \frac{2}{1 + \exp\left(-\frac{t-t_c}{\tau}\right)}$$

### P1: CMB Power Spectrum
$$C_\ell = C_\ell^{\Lambda\text{CDM}} \cdot \left(\frac{\ell}{\ell_*}\right)^{4-d_s(t_{\text{CMB}})}$$

### P2: GW Dispersion
$$\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 \left[1 + \frac{\beta_0}{2}\left(\frac{E}{E_{\text{Pl}}}\right)^{\alpha}\right]$$

### BH Dimension Compression
$$d_s(r) = 4 - \frac{r_s}{r} \cdot \Theta(r - r_s)$$

## Independence Statement

This work is **independent** of the M-series (M-1 through M-10) of the Advanced-Theoretical-Framework. While M-1's methodological ideas (Fixed 4D + Dynamic $d_s$ paradigm) were influential, all mathematical definitions, theorem proofs, and physical predictions were derived independently within the Fixed-4D-Topology framework.
