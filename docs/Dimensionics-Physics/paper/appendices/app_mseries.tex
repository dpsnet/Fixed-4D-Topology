% Appendix B: Relation to M-Series Framework

\section{Statement of Independence}\label{app:independence}

Dimensionics-Physics is \textbf{independent} of the M-1 through M-10 series. While M-1's methodological ideas were influential, all mathematical definitions, theorem proofs, and physical predictions were derived independently within the Fixed-4D-Topology framework.

\section{What Was Borrowed}\label{app:borrowed}

From M-1:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem formulation methodology
    \item ``Fixed 4D + Dynamic $d_s$'' paradigm
    \item Level system (L1--L3)
\end{itemize}

\section{Independently Developed}\label{app:independent}

\caption{Independence Summary}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Component & M-Series & Dimensionics \\
\midrule
Axioms & Implicit & 9 explicit (A1--A9) \\
Master Equation & Mentioned & Rigorous derivation \\
Beta function & Not specified & $\beta(d) = -\alpha(d-2)(4-d)$ \\
Effective metric & Heuristic & Theorem with proof \\
Modified Lorentz & Not discussed & $SO(3,1; d_s)$ group \\
12 Theorems & Partial & All proved (L1) \\
11 Predictions & Not systematic & Complete with testability \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Summary}\label{app:summary}

M-1 provided the \textbf{seed} (paradigm); Dimensionics grew the \textbf{tree} (rigorous framework).
