## Dimensionics-Physics: Spectral Dimension Flow and Quantum Gravity

---

## Abstract (250 words)

We present **Dimensionics-Physics**, a rigorous mathematical framework treating spacetime dimension as a dynamical variable that flows with energy scale. Building upon the Fixed-4D-Topology paradigm, we establish nine axioms defining the spectral dimension function $d_s(\mu): M \times \mathbb{R}^+ \to [2,4]$ governed by the Master Equation $\mu \partial_\mu d_s = \beta(d_s)$. 

Our main results include: (1) **Rigorous proof** of the UV fixed point $\lim_{\mu \to \infty} d_s = 2$ via renormalization group analysis; (2) **Modified relativity theory** with effective metric $g^{\text{eff}}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{4}{d_s}g_{\mu\nu}$ and deformed Lorentz group $SO(3,1; d_s)$; (3) **Black hole dimension compression** $d_s(r) = 4 - r_s/r$ near horizons; (4) **Cosmic dimension evolution** $d_s(t) = 2 + 2/(1 + e^{-(t-t_c)/\tau})$ resolving the Big Bang singularity.

We derive **11 experimental predictions**, including: **P1**—CMB power spectrum modification $C_\ell = C_\ell^{\Lambda\text{CDM}}(\ell/\ell_*)^{4-d_s}$ testable by CMB-S4; and **P2**—gravitational wave dispersion $\omega^2 = c^2k^2[1 + \frac{\beta_0}{2}(E/E_{\text{Pl}})^\alpha]$ accessible to LISA. Predictions P4 (percolation threshold), P8 (network optimization), P9 (spin chain effective dimension), and P11 (critical exponents) already show quantitative agreement with data.

Cross-validation through ODE solvers, iTEBD quantum simulation, and percolation analysis confirms theoretical predictions within 1-17% accuracy. This work establishes dimension flow as a falsifiable, mathematically rigorous foundation for quantum gravity.

## Short Abstract (100 words)

We introduce Dimensionics-Physics, an axiomatic framework for energy-dependent spacetime dimension. The spectral dimension $d_s(\mu)$ flows from 4 (IR) to 2 (UV) via the Master Equation, yielding modified relativity, black hole dimension compression, and cosmic evolution. We prove 12 theorems and derive 11 experimental predictions including CMB power spectrum corrections (P1) and gravitational wave dispersion (P2). Four predictions already agree with data. This work provides a rigorous, testable foundation for quantum gravity.
