  abstract = {We present Dimensionics-Physics, a rigorous mathematical framework treating spacetime dimension as a dynamical variable that flows with energy scale. Building upon the Fixed-4D-Topology paradigm, we establish nine axioms defining the spectral dimension function governed by the Master Equation. Our main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of the UV fixed point; (2) Modified relativity theory with effective metric and deformed Lorentz group; (3) Black hole dimension compression; (4) Cosmic dimension evolution. We derive 11 experimental predictions, including CMB power spectrum modification and gravitational wave dispersion. Four predictions already agree with data.}
