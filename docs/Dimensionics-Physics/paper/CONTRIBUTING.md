# Contributing to Dimensionics-Physics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Dimensionics-Physics project! This document provides guidelines for contributing.

## 🔬 Research Methodology

This project employs a **human-AI collaborative paradigm** with transparent disclosure:

- **Wang Bin (王斌)**: Provides conceptual direction, research vision, and high-level oversight
- **Kimi 2.5 Agent**: Generates ALL mathematical content, writing, visualizations, and documentation

### ⚠️ Important Limitation

The human researcher **acknowledges limited expertise** in advanced mathematical physics and **cannot rigorously verify** the technical content. Professional peer review is **invited and needed**.

### How You Can Help

We explicitly seek contributions from **professional physicists and mathematicians**:
- Verify mathematical proofs (L1 strictness claimed)
- Check citation accuracy
- Validate physical predictions
- Assess technical rigor

See [RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.md](RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.md) and [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) for detailed information.

If you find errors in the paper, typos, or have suggestions:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Open a new issue** with:
   - Clear title describing the problem
   - Location (chapter, section, equation number)
   - Description of the issue
   - Suggested fix (if applicable)

### Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:
- Fixing typos
- Clarifying explanations
- Adding examples
- Improving figure captions

### Code Contributions

For figure generation scripts or numerical validation code:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test thoroughly**
5. **Submit a pull request**

## Types of Contributions

### 🔬 Scientific Contributions (Priority Needs)

Given the AI-generated nature of this work and limited human verification capability, we especially need:

- **Mathematical verification**: Rigorous review of the 12 theorems and claimed L1 strictness
- **Citation audit**: Verify accuracy of all 84 references
- **Physical validation**: Assess soundness of 11 experimental predictions
- **Technical review**: Independent assessment of mathematical derivations
- **New predictions**: Suggest additional experimental tests (after verification)

### 📝 Documentation Contributions

- **Typos and grammar**: Fix language errors
- **Clarifications**: Improve explanations of complex concepts
- **Examples**: Add worked examples or case studies
- **References**: Suggest additional relevant citations

### 💻 Technical Contributions

- **Figure improvements**: Better visualizations
- **Code optimization**: Faster numerical routines
- **New simulations**: Additional validation methods
- **LaTeX improvements**: Better formatting or macros
