## Cover Letter Components

### Essential Elements
1. **Brief summary** of contribution (2-3 sentences)
2. **Why RMP** is appropriate venue
3. **Suggested reviewers** (3-5 names with emails)
4. **Conflicts of interest** (reviewers to avoid)

### Template Opening
```
Dear Editor,

We submit our manuscript "Dimensionics-Physics: Spectral Dimension 
Flow and Quantum Gravity" for consideration in Reviews in Mathematical 
Physics.

This work establishes a rigorous axiomatic framework for dimension as 
a dynamical variable in quantum gravity, deriving 12 theorems and 11 
experimental predictions including CMB power spectrum modifications 
testable by CMB-S4 and gravitational wave dispersion accessible to LISA.

Suggested reviewers:
1. [Name, Institution, email]
2. [Name, Institution, email]
3. [Name, Institution, email]

Sincerely,
[Corresponding Author]
```
