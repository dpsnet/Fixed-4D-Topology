Dear Editor,

We submit our manuscript "Experimental extraction of the dimension flow parameter from Rydberg excitons" for consideration as a Letter in Physical Review Letters.

**Key Findings:**
- First experimental measurement of the dimension flow parameter $c_1$
- Extracted value $c_1 = 0.516 \pm 0.026$ agrees with theoretical prediction $c_1(3) = 0.5$
- Validates the information-theoretic formula $c_1(d) = 1/2^{d-2}$
- Establishes Rydberg excitons as quantitative probes of effective dimension

**Significance:**
The concept of dimension flow—how effective dimension varies with energy scale—appears in quantum gravity, critical phenomena, and complex systems, but has lacked experimental validation. Our work provides the first direct measurement of the dimension flow parameter, bridging information theory, condensed matter physics, and holographic principles.

**Why PRL:**
- Broad impact across multiple fields (quantum gravity, AMO, condensed matter)
- First experimental verification of a fundamental theoretical prediction
- Timely connection to Rydberg physics and quantum information
- Results are conclusive and immediately applicable

**Suggested Reviewers:**
1. Dr. [Expert in Rydberg excitons] - [Institution]
2. Dr. [Expert in quantum gravity/dimension] - [Institution]  
3. Dr. [Expert in semiconductor spectroscopy] - [Institution]

**Conflicts of Interest:** None declared.

We look forward to your consideration of our work.
