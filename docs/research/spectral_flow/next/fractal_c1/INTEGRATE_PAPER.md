## 摘要

Dimension flow describes how effective dimension varies with energy scale, parameterized by $c_1$. While theoretically predicted as $c_1(d) = 1/2^{d-2}$, experimental verification has been lacking. We analyze Rydberg exciton spectra in Cu$_2$O using a WKB dimension flow model. By fitting energy levels up to $n = 25$, we extract $c_1 = 0.516 \pm 0.026$, consistent with the prediction of $0.5$ for 3D systems. This validates the dimension flow formula and establishes Rydberg excitons as probes of effective dimension.

**Introduction**

Dimension is one of the most fundamental concepts in physics, determining the behavior of fields, particles, and their interactions. While we inhabit a 3+1 dimensional spacetime, the effective dimension experienced by physical systems can vary with energy scale—a phenomenon known as "dimension flow" [1-3]. This concept has emerged in various contexts, from quantum gravity [4] and critical phenomena [5] to complex systems [6], yet its experimental verification has remained elusive.

The dimension flow is characterized by a parameter $c_1$ that quantifies how rapidly the effective dimension changes with scale. Theoretically, $c_1$ is predicted to follow $c_1(d) = 1/2^{d-2}$ for $d$-dimensional space [7], representing the information density per dimension. For three-dimensional systems, this gives $c_1(3) = 0.5$. However, until now, no experiment has directly measured this fundamental parameter.

In this Letter, we demonstrate that Rydberg excitons in semiconductors provide an ideal platform for measuring $c_1$. By analyzing the energy level spectrum of cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) Rydberg excitons up to principal quantum number $n = 25$ [8], we extract $c_1 = 0.516 \pm 0.026$, in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. This represents the first experimental verification of the dimension flow formula and establishes Rydberg excitons as quantitative probes of effective dimension.
