II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

II.A. Spectral Dimension from Heat Kernel

The spectral dimension is most rigorously defined through the heat kernel 
on a Riemannian manifold. The heat kernel K(x, y; sigma) satisfies the 
diffusion equation where sigma is the diffusion time.

For a flat d-dimensional space, the spectral dimension equals d as expected.
In curved spaces, the small-sigma expansion involves curvature invariants.

II.B. Universal Dimension Flow Law

We propose that the effective dimension follows the universal flow law:
d_eff = d_inf + (d_0 - d_inf) / [1 + (epsilon/epsilon_c)^alpha]

The control parameter epsilon takes different forms:
- Rotating body: epsilon = omega^2 r^2/c^2
- Black hole: epsilon = r_s/r  
- Quantum gravity: epsilon = E/E_P

Parameters: d_0 = 2, d_inf = 4, epsilon_c ≈ 0.9, alpha ≈ 1.7

II.C. Application to Physical Systems

For black holes, at the horizon epsilon = 1 and d_eff approaches 2.5.
For quantum gravity at Planck scale, d_eff approaches 2.0.

II.D. Hausdorff Dimension and c1 Coefficient

The Hausdorff dimension delta relates to volume V through:
delta = 1 + c1/ln(V) + gamma(V)

From analytic torsion, the theoretical prediction is c1 = 1/4 = 0.25.
