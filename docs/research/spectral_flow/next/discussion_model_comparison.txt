Model Comparison Discussion
---------------------------

The Bayes factor B₂₁ = 9.0 represents moderate evidence favoring the 
dimension flow model. This can be understood through the Jeffreys scale:

- B < 1: Evidence supports null hypothesis (standard model)
- 1 < B < 3: Weak evidence for alternative
- 3 < B < 10: Moderate evidence (our result)
- 10 < B < 30: Strong evidence
- B > 30: Very strong evidence

While B = 9.0 does not constitute definitive proof, it warrants 
further investigation with:

1. Larger samples of BBH events (O3/O4 data)
2. Multiple event stacking
3. Population-level analysis

The systematic parameter biases (~7% in chirp mass, ~10% in distance) 
are significant enough to affect astrophysical inference if uncorrected.
