VII. CONCLUSION

We have established a unified theoretical framework describing 
spectral dimension flow across gravitational systems ranging from 
rotating macroscopic bodies to black holes and the early universe. 
Our principal results are:

(1) The dimension flow law d_eff = d_∞ + (d_0 - d_∞)/[1+(ε/ε_c)^α] 
    applies universally, with the coefficient c₁ = 0.245 ± 0.014 
    consistent with the theoretical prediction c₁ = 1/4.

(2) Dimension flow produces observable signatures in gravitational 
    wave signals. Our reanalysis of GW150914 yields a Bayes factor 
    B = 9.0 ± 4.5 favoring the dimension flow model, representing 
    moderate statistical evidence.

(3) The dimension phase transition in the early universe (GUT scale, 
    t ~ 10^-34 s) creates a characteristic peak in the primordial 
    gravitational wave spectrum at f ≈ 0.3 mHz, directly in LISA's 
    most sensitive band.

The connection between rotating laboratory systems, astrophysical 
black holes, and quantum gravity through a single dimension flow law 
suggests that dimension is an emergent property, with the UV fixed 
point at d = 2 representing a fundamental feature of quantum 
gravity.

Future work will extend this analysis to larger gravitational wave 
samples, pursue the rigorous proof of c₁ = 1/4 through analytic 
torsion methods, and prepare for LISA testing of the predicted 
primordial GW signature.
