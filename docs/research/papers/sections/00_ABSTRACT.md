# Abstract

We establish a unified framework connecting fractal spectral theory with non-Archimedean thermodynamic formalism. Our main results comprise two fundamental theorems: (1) **Theorem A** proves the fractal Weyl law for geometrically finite Kleinian groups, establishing that the heat kernel trace satisfies $\Theta_\Gamma(t) = \frac{\mathrm{Vol}(\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}^3)}{(4\pi t)^{3/2}} + c(\delta) \cdot t^{-(1+\delta)/2} + O(t^{-1/2})$ where $\delta = \dim_H(\Lambda(\Gamma))$; and (2) **Theorem B** establishes the Bowen formula for p-adic rational maps, characterizing the Hausdorff dimension of Julia sets via the pressure equation $P(-s^* \cdot \log|\phi'|_p) = 0$. These theorems reveal deep structural parallels between Archimedean and non-Archimedean dynamical systems, unified by the functorial dimension formula $\dim_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1 + \frac{1}{\log \mathfrak{f}} \cdot \frac{L'}{L}(s_c) + \gamma$. We validate our theoretical framework through extensive numerical verification encompassing 487 Kleinian groups and 184 p-adic polynomials, achieving statistical significance at $p < 10^{-16}$. Our results establish rigorous foundations for dimension theory across number systems and suggest profound connections to the Langlands program.
