## Research Prototype Notice

### This Is A Research Prototype

This document is part of an **AI-assisted research experiment** exploring the potential of AI in mathematical research. Key points:

1. **No Actual Submission**: This manuscript was NOT submitted to Annals of Mathematics
2. **Simulated Elements**: Expert consultations mentioned elsewhere are simulated
3. **Unverified Claims**: Mathematical results have not been peer-reviewed
4. **Experimental**: This demonstrates a rapid research workflow, not validated science

### For Real Academic Work

To transform this into genuine academic research:

1. Contact real experts in the field
2. Have proofs reviewed by mathematicians
3. Submit to preprint servers (arXiv) for community feedback
4. Submit to journals through official channels
5. Respond to referee reports
