## Target Journal Considerations

### Annals of Mathematics
- **Scope**: Fundamental contributions to all branches of mathematics
- **Requirements**: Exceptional depth and significance
- **Fit**: Strong - addresses fundamental connections between major areas
- **Competition**: Very high
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months initial review

### Inventiones Mathematicae
- **Scope**: Original research in all fields of mathematics
- **Requirements**: High originality and significance
- **Fit**: Strong - novel unified framework
- **Competition**: High
- **Timeline**: 3-6 months initial review

### Duke Mathematical Journal
- **Scope**: Active and influential areas of mathematics
- **Requirements**: High quality research
- **Fit**: Good - interdisciplinary connections
- **Competition**: Moderate to high
- **Timeline**: 2-4 months initial review

## Recommended Submission Order

1. **Primary**: Annals of Mathematics
   - Highest prestige
   - Best fit for fundamental contribution
   - Longest review time acceptable

2. **Secondary**: Inventiones Mathematicae
   - If rejected from Annals
   - Still top-tier venue

3. **Tertiary**: Duke Mathematical Journal
   - If rejected from above
   - Still highly respected

## Post-Submission Plan

### Expected Review Timeline
- Initial acknowledgment: 1-2 weeks
- First review: 3-6 months
- Revision time: 2-3 months
- Second review: 1-2 months
- Final decision: 6-12 months total

### Revision Strategy
- Address all reviewer comments systematically
- Maintain detailed response document
- Be open to major revisions if needed
- Consider splitting if requested (though prefer unified presentation)
