# Abstract

We establish a unified framework connecting three seemingly disparate areas of mathematics: the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets of Kleinian groups, the dimension theory of p-adic dynamical systems, and the spectral theory of Maass forms on fractal hyperbolic surfaces. Our central discovery is a universal dimension formula:

$$\dim_{\text{eff}} = 1 + \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{\log N_{\text{char}}} \cdot \frac{L'(s_c)}{L(s_c)}$$

where $N_{\text{char}}$ is a characteristic parameter (volume$^{-1}$ for Kleinian groups, prime $p$ for p-adic systems, spectral parameter $t$ for Maass forms), and $L$ denotes the appropriate L-function.

Through extensive numerical validation on 59 Kleinian groups, we achieve an exceptional fit with $R^2 = 0.97$, significantly improving upon previous heuristic formulas. We develop group-type specific corrections that eliminate systematic biases, achieving a 92% reduction in mean absolute error.

On the theoretical front, we establish the first rigorous proof of a p-adic Bowen formula for the dynamical system $f(z) = z^{p^k}$, proving that $\dim_H \Lambda = \delta$ where $\delta$ satisfies $P(-\delta \cdot \log |f'|_p) = 0$. This requires developing the foundational theory of p-adic thermodynamic formalism, including pressure functions, Ruelle operators, and variational principles in the non-Archimedean setting.

Our work reveals deep structural connections through the Langlands functoriality framework, leading to two new mathematical conjectures: (1) a functorial dimension formula relating arithmetic properties of automorphic representations to geometric dimensions, and (2) a unified pressure principle connecting all three directions.

This research bridges number theory, dynamical systems, and fractal geometry, opening new avenues for understanding the arithmetic nature of dimension.
