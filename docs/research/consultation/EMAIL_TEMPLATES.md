Subject: Consultation Request: Fractal Spectral Theory and [Expert's Specialty]

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I am writing to request a brief consultation regarding research at the intersection 
of fractal geometry, p-adic dynamics, and the Langlands program. We have achieved 
a significant milestone—what we call "L1 rigorous proof"—but seek expert guidance 
before proceeding to final publication.

PROJECT SUMMARY
We are investigating deep structural connections between:
• Spectral asymptotics on fractals (Sierpiński gasket)
• Thermodynamic formalism for p-adic polynomial dynamics
• Fractal extensions of Langlands-type operators

Our main result unifies three definitions of pressure (thermodynamic, Maass, and 
Berkovich) via a "Ruelle-Langlands operator" construction.

WHY YOUR EXPERTISE
[Personalized section - see below for each expert]

WHAT WE SEEK
A 30-60 minute consultation (video call or email exchange) on three technical 
questions:
1. [Specific question 1]
2. [Specific question 2]  
3. [Specific question 3]

MATERIALS
I have attached:
• 2-page project overview
• Technical questions tailored to your expertise
• Brief proof summary (L1 status)

These materials are confidential and prepared specifically for your consultation.

NEXT STEPS
If you are willing to discuss, please let me know your availability in the coming 
weeks. If you are unable to consult directly, referrals to colleagues or 
suggestions for literature would also be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for considering this request. Your work in [specific area] has been 
foundational to our approach.

Sincerely,

## Template 2: Personalized Openings by Expert

### For Robert Benedetto

```
WHY YOUR EXPERTISE
Your monograph "Dynamics in One Non-Archimedean Variable" has been our primary 
reference for the p-adic components of this work. Specifically, your treatment 
of Berkovich Julia sets and measure theory in non-Archimedean dynamics is 
central to our thermodynamic formalism construction.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
1. Gibbs measure uniqueness conditions on Berkovich Julia sets
2. Technical verification of our Berkovich space constructions
3. Comparison with complex dynamics: essential differences
```

### For Juan Rivera-Letelier

```
WHY YOUR EXPERTISE
Your groundbreaking work on the ergodic theory of p-adic rational maps, 
particularly your analysis of the measure of maximal entropy and equidistribution 
results, provides the foundation for our Gibbs measure construction.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
1. Extending thermodynamic formalism beyond expanding maps
2. Handling critical points in p-adic thermodynamics
3. Simplification opportunities unique to the p-adic setting
```

### For Richard Taylor

```
WHY YOUR EXPERTISE
Your contributions to the Langlands program, including the proof of the local 
Langlands correspondence and work on Galois representations, inform our attempt 
to extend Langlands-type structures to fractal settings. We are particularly 
interested in whether our "fractal Hecke operators" connect to established theory.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
1. Precedents for Hecke theory on fractal limit sets
2. Connections between L'/L and fractal dimension
3. Obstacles to Jacquet-Langlands for fractal representations
```

### For Peter Sarnak

```
WHY YOUR EXPERTISE
Your work on quantum chaos, L-functions, and the spectral theory of automorphic 
forms provides essential context for our investigation of spectral asymptotics. 
Your papers on the Riemann zeta function and random matrix theory connections 
are particularly relevant to our oscillatory term analysis.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
1. Known relationships between L-function derivatives and geometric invariants
2. Maass-type pressure definitions from the automorphic perspective
3. Connections between our framework and the GUE hypothesis
```

### For Curtis McMullen

```
WHY YOUR EXPERTISE
Your work on Hausdorff dimension and conformal dynamics, particularly your 
research on Kleinian groups and Teichmüller theory, informs our approach to 
dimension formulas and thermodynamic formalism. Your algorithms for computing 
Hausdorff dimension are the gold standard in the field.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
1. Fundamental reasons for pressure formula unification
2. Extensions to non-uniformly hyperbolic settings
3. Analogy with Teichmüller theory: fractal interpretation
```

### For Mark Pollicott

```
WHY YOUR EXPERTISE
Your contributions to thermodynamic formalism, particularly your work on zeta 
functions for interval maps and transfer operator methods, are directly applicable 
to our unified pressure framework. Your book with Yuri is our standard reference.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
1. Thermodynamic formalism on fractal limit sets with overlaps
2. Verification of our unified pressure formula status
3. Generalization possibilities: random IFS, infinite alphabets
```
