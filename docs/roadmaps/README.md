## Phase 5+ Research Extension

Based on user direction, the T3 replacement research continues with Phase 5+ focusing on:

1. **Theoretical Breakthroughs**: Resolving coefficient 0.244, subhyperbolic Bowen formula
2. **Application Deepening**: Quantum chaos, arithmetic geometry applications
3. **Methodological Innovation**: Categorical framework formalization
4. **Spectral Dimension Flow**: Mathematical theory of dimension flow (newly added)
